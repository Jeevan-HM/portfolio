Research Experience

Researcher — RISE Lab, Arizona State University | Tempe, AZ | Jun 2025 – Present

Built an automated ROS + Python pipeline to capture high-frequency pneumatic pressure streams and motion-capture trajectories with precise time-sync and validation, producing an analysis-ready, high-dimensional time-series dataset for control modeling.
Analyzed system dynamics (MATLAB + Python) to surface temporal dependencies and transients; insights informed feature engineering for downstream closed-loop controllers.
Led baseline pneumatic control modeling (regularized linear regression + scikit-learn GridSearchCV), achieving a 7% improvement in control accuracy vs. baseline.
Collaborated with ASU and Virginia Tech on nonlinear, closed-loop strategies: real-time forecasting with AutoTS, LSTM controllers, and policy-gradient RL to enhance stability and adaptive response.

Research Aide — IDEA Lab, Arizona State University | Tempe, AZ | Sep 2024 – Jun 2025

Automated a ROS data system for a quadruped: synchronized multi-modal sensors (IMU, camera, LiDAR) and applied Kalman filtering to obtain high-fidelity pose and velocity estimates for stable locomotion and mapping.
Built a MuJoCo training environment and implemented PPO to learn walking, pacing, and trotting gaits with policies designed for real-world transfer.
Executed sim-to-real transfer of learned gait parameters; delivered a Flask-based UI for real-time state visualization and parameter tuning, accelerating on-robot experiments.
